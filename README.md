### Introduction
In social science, an online community fills the roles of activity, language use, and social interactions. Metadata and linguistic summary are investigated in the real online forum. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was used for the linguistic analysis, which assessed the prevalence of specific thoughts, feelings, and motivations by calculating the proportion of key words used in communication. Furthermore, 20,000 posts are used in the analysis, which are chosen at random from the original dataset, and it will then become the main focus of the analysis.
There are three major areas to be examined. To begin, the forum's activity and language are tracked over time. Second, the language used is examined by various groups. Finally, online social networks are examined.
